\textbf{The technological landscape} has been \textit{witnessing} unprecedented growth in the recent decades. The onset of the internet has redefined the functionality of previously standalone devices, transforming them into interlinked components of an integrated network. This has led to the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), a sophisticated network of physical devices, embedded with sensors, processors, and connectivity, that enables seamless data transmission across broader networks, thereby dissolving the barrier between users and technology.

The impact of \gls{IoT} can be felt in almost every aspect of our lives, from automobiles and street lights to home appliances, healthcare systems, and even digital assistants. This extensive interconnectivity results in a world where IoT devices are attached to the internet facilitating communication of data through embedded sensors and software\cite{Hukkeri}. These mostly autonomous devices inturn reduces amount of effort required by humans, empowering us to make decisions that ease our lifestyle.

The concept of connecting unconnected devices dates back to 1832, following the invention of the first electromagnetic telegraph. The term ``Internet of Things (IoT)" was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999, heralding a new era of digital communication and human interaction.


Today, as the number of connected devices skyrockets and IoT technology permeates industrial and commercial sectors, the potential of this technology is enormous. However, this progression is not without challenges, especially concerning security and privacy. The increasing prevalence of threats and security challenges are cause for concern. This paper aims to delve deep into these challenges, informed by a systematic review of previously undertaken research articles, presenting an in-depth analysis of the security and privacy issues inherent in IoT. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current IoT threat landscape, aiding in the development of robust countermeasures to these pressing challenges.
