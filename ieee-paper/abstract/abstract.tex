\begin{abstract}
    As Internet of Things (IoT) devices become more common in our daily lives, the security risks they pose become a more pressing issue. This paper presents a comprehensive review of current literature and an in-depth exploration of the IoT threat landscape. The review of existing studies highlights the surge in research addressing the safety, confidentiality, and privacy challenges associated with IoT. This includes comprehensive analyses of security-related issues for networks, devices, and systems, along with potential solutions such as lightweight computation, classification of security attacks, and advanced access control mechanisms. The paper further looks into the role of innovative technologies like fog computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain in bolstering IoT security. We'll also look at the types of attacks we're facing, from Sybil, deceptive, and spoofing attacks to \textbf{Man-in-the-Middle}, buffer overflow, and Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Given the increasing craftiness of hackers and the built-in vulnerabilities of IoT devices, it is clear that we need solid, multi-layered defense strategies to keep up. This paper aims to serve as a guide for future research and practical approaches to IoT security, emphasizing the urgent need for robust and technical interventions.
