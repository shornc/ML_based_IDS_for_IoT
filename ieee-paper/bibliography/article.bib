abstract = {Embedded, mobile, and cyberphysical systems are becoming ubiquitous and are used in many applications, from consumer electronics, industrial control systems, modern vehicles, to critical infrastructures. Current trends and initiatives, such as Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities, promise innovative business models and novel user experiences through strong connectivity and effective use of next generation embedded devices. These systems generate, process, and exchange vast amount of security-critical and privacy-sensitive data, which makes them attractive targets of attacks. Cyberattacks on IoT systems are highly critical since they may cause physical damage and threaten human lives. The complexity of these systems, the lack of security and privacy by design for current IoT devices, and potential impact of cyberattacks will bring about new threats. This paper gives an overview on the related security and privacy challenges, and an outlook on possible solutions towards a holistic security framework for IoT systems.},

abstract = {Internet of Things is The network that means all the
living and non-living things will be connected to each other
in this network and further this network will interconnect
with other networks forming a bigger network. IoT is facing
many issues and challenges in the development, particularly
related to security in the IoT environment. Even though
there are many researchers who have analyzed such issues
and challenges, there is no particular method to apply for
IoT applications to overcome the problems of IoT issues and
challenges. This paper briefs the IoT issues and challenges
along with the methods for providing solutions and how we
can ensure security in the IoT network. IoT best practices
that are securing networks, securing devices and securing
overall IoT systems are also discussed in this paper. Since
IoT is a growing technology in todays life it is very important to solve IoT issues and understanding its challenges for
the betterment.},

  abstract={In this work, we present the results of a study on the detrimental effects of sinkhole attacks on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) which employ the Routing Protocol for LLNs (Low-power and Lossy Networks). A sinkhole is a compromised node which attempts to capture traffic with the intent to drop messages, thus degrading the end-to-end delivery performance, that is, reducing the number of messages successfully delivered to their destination. The mechanism by which the sinkhole captures traffic is by advertising an attractive route to its neighbors. We evaluate two countermeasures addressing the sinkhole problem: a parent fail-over and a rank authentication technique. We show via simulation that while each technique, applied alone, does not work all that well, the combination of the two techniques significantly improves the performance of a network under attack. We also demonstrate that, with the defenses described, increasing the density of the network can combat a penetration of sinkholes nodes, without needing to identify the sinkholes.},
